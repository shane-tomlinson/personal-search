object Since AFrame tries to be somewhat AOP with its use of Plugins, and often times those Plugins depend on knowing when the plugged object is initialized, it is recommended to use a class' create function instead of the 'new' operator to do object instantiation. Most AFrame.AObject based classes do very little in their constructors, and do their initialization in the 'init' function. This allows us to create an object and all of its plugins, then have the plugins take action whenever their plugged object is initialized. All AFrame.AObject based items have a CID.

object Since AFrame tries to be somewhat AOP with its use of Plugins, and often times those Plugins depend on knowing when the plugged object is initialized, it is recommended to use a class' create function instead of the 'new' operator to do object instantiation. Most AFrame.AObject based classes do very little in their constructors, and do their initialization in the 'init' function. This allows us to create an object and all of its plugins, then have the plugins take action whenever their plugged object is initialized. All AFrame.AObject based items have a CID.

Here's how to allow your program to gracefully exit: var readline = require('readline'); var rl = readline.createInterface({ input: process.stdin, output: process.stdout }); rl.question(\"What do you think of","title":"Readline Node.js v0.8.14 Manual & Documentation","url":"http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html"},"http://nodejs.org/api/repl.html":{"words":["0","1","2","3","4","8","14","5001","2053342","2209310","home","download","about","npm","registry","docs","blog","community","logos","jobs","@nodejs","node","js","v0","manual","","amp","documentation","index","|","view","on","single","page","as","json","table","of","contents","repl","start","options","event","'exit'","features","a","read","eval","print","loop","is","available","both","standalone","program","and","easily","includable","in","other","programs","the","provides","way","to","interactively","run","javascript","see","results","it","can","be","used","for","debugging","testing","or","just","trying","things","out","by","executing","without","any","arguments","from","command","line","you","will","dropped","into","has","simplistic","emacs","editing","mjr","type","'","help'","gt","[","3]","]","foreach","function","v","console","log","advanced","editors","with","environmental","variable","no","readline","this","main","debugger","canonical","terminal","settings","which","allow","use","rlwrap","example","could","add","your","bashrc","file","alias","\"env","node\"","returns","starts","replserver","instance","accepts","an","\"options\"","object","that","takes","following","values","prompt","stream","all","i","o","defaults","input","readable","listen","process","stdin","output","writable","write","data","stdout","pass","true","if","should","treated","like","tty","have","ansi","vt100","escape","codes","written","checking","istty","upon","instantiation","each","given","async","wrapper","below","custom","usecolors","boolean","specifies","whether","not","writer","colors","different","set","then","does","nothing","repl's","value","useglobal","global","instead","running","scripts","separate","context","false","ignoreundefined","return","it's","undefined","invoke","gets","evaluated","formatting","including","coloring","display","util","inspect","own","signature","cmd","filename","callback","null","result","multiple","repls","may","started","against","same","share","but","unique","here","unix","socket","tcp","var","net","require","\"net\"","\"repl\"","connections","\"node","via","\"","createserver","+","end","tmp","sock\"","clients","connect","through","telnet","useful","connecting","sockets","socat","starting","based","server","long","restarting","\"full","featured\"","over","https","gist","github","com","curl","emitted","when","user","exits","defined","ways","namely","typing","exit","at","pressing","ctrl+c","twice","signal","sigint","ctrl+d","\"end\"","listening","r","'got","\"exit\"","inside","control+d","multi","expressions","tab","completion","supported","local","variables","special","underscore","contains","last","expression","\"a\"","\"b\"","\"c\"","'a'","'b'","'c'","length","access","scope","expose","explicitly","assigning","associated","test","msg","\"message\"","m","appear","within","'message'","there","are","few","commands","break","while","inputting","sometimes","get","lost","don't","care","completing","clear","resets","empty","clears","close","cause","help","show","list","save","current","session","load","key","combinations","these","effects","lt","ctrl","c","similar","keyword","terminates","press","blank","forcibly","d","copyright","joyent","inc","trademark","license"],"summary":"Home Download About npm Registry Docs Blog Community Logos Jobs @nodejs Node.js v0.8.14 Manual &amp; Documentation Index | View on single page | View as JSON Table of Contents REPL repl.start(options) Event: 'exit' REPL Features REPL # A Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is available both as a standalone program and easily includable in other programs.

I was nervous going into the event because it has been a long time since I have spoken to a large group, but everyone was so supportive that I had a fantastic time talking about Mozilla Persona, answering questions and chatting with people afterwards.

comments Last year I wrote SuperClass, A Complete Bastardization of the Javascript Inheritance Model. Chains is a similar experiment, but instead of single inheritance with a this.super function, the idea is to give Javascript multiple-inheritance like functionality through composition. Chains compose functionality out of one or more links. A link is part mixin, part class in an inheritance hierarchy. Each link provides a set of functions. Links can be composed into any number of chains similar to a mixin. If two or more links have a function of the same name, these functions can be called in sequence like in traditional inheritance. The Reasons/The Need Classical-like inheritance and mixins have several limitations in Javascript.

Javascript Inheritance is actually pretty awesome, it’s prototypal inheritance model is supremely flexible as well as a memory efficient. Unfortunately for me, and probably many others that come from a Classical Inheritance background, we keep thinking in terms of Classes. Javascript dogmatists are always up in arms about this, saying we should use Javascript in the way Javascript was meant to be used – meh.

Yes, I’m patting myself on the back. I (as far as I know) have the world’s first WordPress installation that takes advantage of the “siteName” and “siteLogo” feature of Mozilla Persona. I think I am the first because I just got done writing the implementation. Marcel Bokhorst’s great WordPress Plugin is 3 days shy of a year old. Marcel had the plugin ready 24 hours after BrowserID’s initial release and has been keeping it up to date ever since. I highly recommend using it on your own WordPress installation.

For BrowserID, we use box-sizing: border-box on all of our elements using the following snippet of CSS: * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -o-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } This bit of CSS makes most elements use the old IE box-model – a box model that is much more sane than the W3C standard box model. Using the border-box box-model, the width and height of an element includes the element’s padding and border. See Paul Irish’s article on why this is awesome. The strangeness I saw this week only occurrs in Firefox and IE – when setting the min-xxx of an element that has a padding, these browsers use the W3C box model instead of the border-box box model.

The problem is, it is easy to open users up to XSS attacks using a naive solution. Last week I had a look around the interwebs to see what the gods could teach me and came across a solution on Stack Overflow that uses the browser’s DOM. A naive solution is: function strip(html) { var tmp = document.createElement(\\\"DIV\\\"); tmp.innerHTML = html; return tmp.textContent||tmp.innerText; } I read through the answer and thought “Awesome! Let the browser do the heavy lifting!” This solution seems both reasonable and safe from XSS – scripts are not supposed to be run until they are attached to the DOM (or so I thought).

It is easy to operate on a single object, but working with a tree necessitates boilerplate work. What do I mean by this? Say an object “data” exists that represents the root node of a tree of data. Assume this tree is already pre-populated from a web service API call.

This is a real shame because I feel like the quality of my writing has dropped considerably too. I am far more conscious of what and how I write, especially in email to colleagues. This has the bewildering effect that instead of sending out well written messages explaining my point of view, I send out a bunch of jumbled thoughts riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. Such is the strange effect of self-consciousness. The silly reason I have not been writing is because I added my blog to Planet Mozilla and then became very self-conscious.

I was nervous going into the event because it has been a long time since I have spoken to a large group, but everyone was so supportive that I had a fantastic time talking about Mozilla Persona, answering questions and chatting with people afterwards.

Use your browser's \"Save Image As\" functionality to save the image. Your browser does not support Canvas. I'm sorry, your browser does not support the canvas element. If it did, you could create an image that you could copy to use as a CSS background on your site. Try Firefox 3+, Safari 3+, Chrome 3+, Opera 10+, or IE9+.
